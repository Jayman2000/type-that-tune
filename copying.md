# Copying Information for Type That Tune

This repo complies with [this specific version of the REUSE
Specification][1].

The REUSE Specification treats all items on items on [the SPDX License
List][2] as licences. Confusingly, some items on the SPDX License List
are more than just licenses and some aren‚Äôt even licenses at all. For
example, [`GPL-2.0-only` can act as a contract][3] and [`CCO-1.0` is a
public domain dedication][4]. In order to be REUSE-compliant, this repo
must refer to items on the SPDX License List as licenses, even if they
aren‚Äôt actually licenses. Additionally, the REUSE Specification requires
that you put copyright notices on many files, even if those files aren‚Äôt
actually copyrightable.

If a file contains `SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0` that doesn‚Äôt
necessarily mean that the file is licensed in anyway. You‚Äôll need to
look at the text of `CC0-1.0` to figure out the legal status of that
file. Additionally, if that same file contains an
`SPDX-FileCopyrightText` tag, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the
file is copyrighted. Again, you‚Äôll need to look at the text of `CC0-1.0`
for details.

All of this repo‚Äôs Git metadata (commit messages, annotated tags, hashes
etc.) is dedicated to the public domain using [üÖ≠üÑç1.0][5].
