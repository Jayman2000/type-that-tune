# Copying Information for Type That Tune

This repo complies with [this specific version of the REUSE
Specification][1].

Please note that some items on [the SPDX License List][2] aren‚Äôt
necessarily licenses. For example, [`GPL-2.0-only` can act as a
contract][3] and [`CCO-1.0` is a public domain dedication][4]. If a file
contains `SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0` that doesn‚Äôt necessarily
mean that the file is licensed in anyway. You‚Äôll need to look at
`CC0-1.0` to figure out the legal status of that file. Additionally, if
that file contains an `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` tag, that doesn‚Äôt
necessarily mean that the file is copyrighted. Again, you‚Äôll need to
look at `CC0-1.0` for details.

All of this repo‚Äôs Git metadata (commit messages, annotated tags, hashes
etc.) is dedicated to the public domain using [üÖ≠üÑç1.0][5].
